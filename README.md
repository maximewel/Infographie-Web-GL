# Infographie
This project hosts our regular exercices and projects of the WebGL course (Infographie, DLM bachelor 3rd year)

## Structure of the repo
This repository is composed of the HTML files of our exercices. To run them :
* Clone this repository to get the HTML files
* Go to the course [website](webgl3d.info) and download the base [exercice folder](webgl3d.info/ex/ex.zip)
* Unzip the exercice folder, ditch the HTML files, and copy the folders you need (Js, etc...)
* Run the HTML files in your browser ! :)

## Credits
* The HTML files noted [modified] are modified by our group
* The JS libraries, the basic folder and every HTML file not marked modified are from the basic exercice folder
* Thanks to M.Le Callenec and M.Gobron for the base, HE-Arc Neuchatel
